    "## TLDR \n",
    "\n",
    "For this article, I'm going to explore data provided by Funding Circle, a peer-to-peer online lending platform for Small and Medium size Enterprises. It is Europe’s largest marketplace connecting business borrowers and investors, where businesses can lower the cost of their credit and enjoy a better experience than traditional bank lending, and investors earn attractive risk-adjusted returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "By applying survival analysis to the borrower data an investor can identify mis-priced loans to earn above average returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Update: Since September 2017 Funding Circle no longer allows investors to choose individual loan investments and has become closer to a regular deposit taking institution than a P2P lender. However, the approach below can be transferred to other platforms that publish data.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**How Funding Circle works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Businesses requiring a loan apply to fundingcircle.com\n",
    "\n",
    "- Funding Circle assess the risk, determine a credit rating (A+ to E) which determines the appropriate interest rates. Prior to Oct 2015 interest rates were decided through a much purer bidding mechanism, a process that generated valuable data itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Investors ranging from individuals to institutions select new loans, or existing loans on the secondary market, in which to invest and can earn monthly returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "More details can be found on the Funding Circle site.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The data**\n",
    "\n",
    "Funding Circle make loan data available on their website to registered customers. The data consists of a CSV file covering all loans arranged through Funding Circle and is updated every Thursday. The file contains details of the borrower from the loan application (Sector, region, business type, etc.), details of the loan, data appended by Funding Circle\n",
    "\n",
    "The information available for each loan consists of all the details of the loans at the time of their issuance as well as more information relative to the latest status of loan such as how much principal has been paid so far, how much interest, if the loan was fully paid or defaulted, or if the borrower is late on payments."

    "  **Patsy** is used to describe and specify statistical models, \n",
    "  **Fuzzywuzzy** is a library for fuzzy string matching, and finally \n",

    "A crosstab of defaults by year of origination and credit risk band shows a couple of interesting insights. Ignoring 2010, which had very low loan volumes, default rates for loans originated in the early years are pretty high, 16% for Credit Band A and 20.1% for risk band B loans from 2011. The credit bands themselves were also unreliable with default rates of 11.6% for band C (the lowest at the time) and almost identical 11.5% for band A in 2012. I suspect this was a result of a cold start problem for Funding Circle, they just didn't have historic data to build accurate risk models."

    "Traditionally, survival analysis was developed to measure lifespans of individuals. The analysis can be further applied to not just traditional births and deaths, but any duration to an event. A birth can mean a new subscriber and a death event can mean cancellation. In our case a birth will be a loan origination date and a death event would be a default. The aim of survival modelling is to model the relationship between the  outcome event and independent predictor variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Survival modelling?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Survival modelling is better suited to fc data than classification modelling. The reason is that for most of fc's loans we only have a partial picture of a loan's survival. For loans that have defaulted or been repaid, the survival time is the outcome we're interested in, but for loans repaying the observations are incomplete, we only know the status today. A 60 month loan taken out two months ago, still has 58 months in which it could default. We cannot say it's comparable to a 60 month loans that was repaid last month. We say the data for observations that are incomplete are censored. A lot of fc's loans are right-censored, i.e. the loans still have duration and we cannot observe if they will, or won't, default in future. \n",
    " \n",
    "Censoring causes problems for univariate analysis, the means, standard deviations and medians, etc. are all incorrect. It also causes problems for classification modelling if we ignore the censoring as we won't be estimating the true survival time distribution. We could restrict the data we model to loans that have, or would have, reached the end of their term, but that throws away (lots of) data and skews observations to older loans.\n",
    " \n",
    "Survival modelling allows us to overcome these problems.\n",
    " \n",
    "I'm going to be using Cam Davidson-Pilon's excellent Python package Lifelines https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/lifelines for the survival analysis along with the purposeful selection modelling approach outlined in Applied Survival Analysis by Hosmer and Lemeshow, long considered the bible for regression modelling of time to event data. Purposeful selection is a method that is completely controlled by the analyst and generates insight "
